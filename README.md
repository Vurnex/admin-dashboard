## What I learned while working on the project:

- Much better understanding of how Grid works.
- When to use Grid vs Flexbox.
- Using the px unit can be better for responsiveness. vh can be better for the entire page or container.
- While working on the project, I found that using px has been much better for positioning items within grid containers. 
- Learned how to use SASS. The Nesting it provides is a convenient feature.

## Frameworks and Tools Used In This Project
